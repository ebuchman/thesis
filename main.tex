\chapter*{Abstract}
Tendermint Rocks.

\chapter*{Preface}
The structure and presentation of this thesis was directly inspired by Diego Ongaro's 2014 Doctoral Dissertation, 
"Consensus: Bridging Theory and Practice", wherein he specifies and evaluates the Raft consensus algorithm.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I learned early in life that a man has only two things in this world, his word and his balls, and he should break em for no one \cite{scarface}. 
This thesis would not have been completed if I had not given my word to certain people that I would complete it.
These include my family, in particular my parents, grandparents, and great uncle Paul, and my primary advisor, Graham,
who has, for one reason or another, permitted me a practically abusive amount of flexibility to pursue the topic of my choosing.
Thanks Graham.

Were it not for another set of individuals, this thesis would probably have been about machine learning.
These include Vlad Zamfir, with whom I have experienced countless moments of discovery and insight;
My previous employer and favorite company, Eris Industries, and especially their CEO and COO, Casey Kuhlman and Preston Byrne,
for hiring me, mentoring me, and giving me such freedom to research and tinker and ultimately start my own company with technology they helped fund;
Jae Kwon, for his direct mentorship in consensus science and programming, for being a great collaborator, and for being the core founder and CEO at Tendermint;
Zach Ramsay, for being, for all intents and purposes, my heterosexual husband;
and of course, Satoshi Nakamoto, whomever you are, for sending me down this damned rabbit hole in the first place.

There are of course many other people who have influenced my life during the course of this graduate degree;
you know who you are, and I thank you for being that person and for all you've done for me.
